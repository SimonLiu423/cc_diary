## Getting Started

CC Diary is currently in active development and not yet available for public use. There are a few reasons for this:

1. API Costs: The app relies on GPT API, which incurs costs for each use. We're working on optimizing this to make the app sustainable.
2. Backend Infrastructure: We're in the process of securing a reliable and cost-effective server solution to host our backend services.

We're excited about the potential of CC Diary and are working hard to make it available to users as soon as possible. Stay tuned for updates on our progress!

If you're a developer interested in contributing to the project, please check out our [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more information on how you can get involved.

## Usage

## Awards

- Continuously enhance user data analysis to provide objective insights into users' mental and physical conditions
