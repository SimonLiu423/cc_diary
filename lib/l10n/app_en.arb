    "suggestion": "If the symptoms mentioned above persist and are pronounced, you should seek help from a specialist physician.",
    "depressionSymptom":"Depression symptoms include a persistent low mood, feeling hopeless, and fatigue for at least two weeks. These may be accompanied by hypersomnia or insomnia, significant appetite reduction leading to weight loss, decreased libido, impaired memory and concentration, lowered self-esteem, chest pain, and possibly self-harm or suicidal thoughts and behaviors.",
    "depressionExplanation":"Patients and their families often struggle to distinguish between normal bouts of sadness and clinical depression. Normal sadness typically does not persist for more than two weeks and can be alleviated by listening to music, talking with friends, or engaging in outdoor activities, without significantly affecting daily life, interpersonal relationships, or academic and professional performance.\nConversely, if depressive feelings persist for more than two weeks, are intractable, and are accompanied by sluggish behavior, excessive time spent in bed, reduced memory and attention, thoughts of suicide or actual suicidal behaviors, significant impacts on sleep and appetite, and notably impair daily functions such as work or academic performance, it is advised to seek medical evaluation.\nIt is also recommended that family and friends, if noticing similar symptoms in someone close, should avoid being overly critical, asking things like 'Why can't you just be happy?' or 'Can't you look on the bright side?' Such comments can deepen their sorrow, as these individuals are not unwilling to feel happier; rather, they are likely experiencing reduced secretion of chemicals like dopamine in their brain. Thus, such inquiries could further damage their self-esteem. It is important to play a supportive listener role while also being mindful of one's own mental state.",
    "depressionGroups":"Depression can occur at any age and is a relatively common mental illness. Early treatment of depression can lead to a quicker and more complete recovery of normal functions. Potential triggers include life stress, personal background, genetic predisposition, postpartum depression, and Seasonal Affective Disorder (commonly occurring in winter). Thus, it is helpful to provide relevant information during medical consultations.",
    "bipolarSymptom":"This condition is characterized by bipolar fluctuations in mood, alternating between depressive (depressive state) and manic (manic state) episodes.",
    "bipolarExplanation":"Depressive State: As described on the depression page.\nManic State: Primarily marked by an excessively elevated mood and euphoria, accompanied by an abundance of energy, incessant talking, constant phone use, excessive confidence, a strong belief in one’s abilities, unrealistic optimism, a belief that one can succeed in everything, sometimes even delusions of grandeur. There may be inappropriate and excessive planning, reckless spending or investing, spending a lot of money or time on pleasurable activities such as dancing, clubbing, inappropriate sexual contacts, etc. Despite reduced sleep, one may still feel extremely energetic, even believing that sleep is unnecessary. Appetite might increase or decrease due to excessive activity and busyness.",
    "bipolarGroups":"The onset of this disorder often begins in adolescence, but can also start in young adulthood or middle age. Two-thirds of cases start with depression and one-third with a manic episode. While most individuals with bipolar disorder can recover from these episodes with treatment, the majority experience recurrences. Regular medical treatment can reduce these relapses, improving the patient's function in life and work, and minimizing negative impacts on the patient and their family.",
    "anxietySymptom":"Anxiety is characterized by an intensity and duration that far exceed the triggering situation, significantly impacting the individual’s life, social interactions, work, and relationships.",
    "anxietyExplanation":"Common symptoms include excessive worry or fear that something bad will happen; trembling, twitching, or feeling shaky; fatigue, weakness; muscle tension or restlessness; dizziness or headaches; rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath; cold sweats or sweaty palms; dry mouth, nausea, or diarrhea; impatience, and irritability. However, anxiety is a very common emotional experience that everyone from children to the elderly will encounter. Thus, not all anxiety is an abnormal response. Appropriate levels of anxiety should not only be avoided but can also help individuals perform above their usual level.\nThe basis for diagnosis typically involves an 'excessive' reaction and adopting stronger measures to avoid the sources of anxiety. For example, a patient might fear losing their job due to the travel and social interactions required for work or might refuse a job in a high-rise building due to a fear of elevators.",
    "anxietyGroups":"Clinically diagnosed cases show that women are about twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with this disorder. The onset age is often unclear, but most patients begin seeking medical help around their twenties to thirties.",
    "schizophreniaSymptom":"The disorder is primarily characterized by two main symptoms: delusions and hallucinations.",
    "schizophreniaExplanation":"Delusions are firmly held beliefs in things that are not real. Examples include:\n· Persecutory Delusions: Firm belief that family members or colleagues are conspiring to harm the individual.\n· Delusions of Being Watched or Followed: Conviction that one is being monitored or followed whenever they leave the house.\n· Referential Delusions: Belief that media like television and newspapers are broadcasting stories about them, or feeling that strangers on the street are paying special attention to them.\n· Delusions of Control: Belief that one's body, thoughts, or actions are being controlled by external forces, such as electromagnetic waves.\n\n· Hallucinations involve sensing things that are not present. Examples include:\n· Auditory Hallucinations: Hearing voices that insult or comment on one’s thoughts or behaviors, even though no one is present. These voices might discuss the person among themselves, leading to the individual speaking or shouting back at the air, or even engaging in odd behaviors such as running out of the house at night or self-harm.\n· Other Hallucinations: These can cause disjointed speech, answering questions irrelevantly, or speaking incoherently; they may also lead to disorganized behavior like streaking, wandering aimlessly, or acting out violently.\n\n· Negative Symptoms: These may appear after an acute phase and include a flat affect, neglect of personal hygiene, minimal speech, rigid thinking, lack of interaction with others, lethargy, and a general loss of interest in life.",
    "schizophreniaGroups":"Schizophrenia typically begins in adolescence. The onset age for males is usually between 15-25 years old, while for females, it is generally about five years later. Early symptoms are not easily detectable and often manifest as obstacles in interpersonal relationships, academic performance, and daily activities, such as withdrawal from social interactions, lack of friends, seclusion in one's room, noticeable decline in school performance, reluctance to attend school, staying in bed, and a lack of interest in activities.",
    "delusionalSymptom":"The primary symptom is a single delusion, without accompanying hallucinations, disorganized speech or behavior, or negative symptoms.",
    "delusionalExplanation":"The disorder typically centers around one predominant delusion, often intertwined with reality, making it sound plausible.\n· Persecutory Delusions: Firm belief that someone is out to harm oneself.\n· ealous Delusions: Convinced belief that one’s spouse or intimate partner is being unfaithful.\n· Grandiose Delusions: Firm belief that one is a great person with significant abilities.\n· Erotomanic Delusions: Conviction that someone of higher status, like a celebrity, is expressing love in various ways.\n· Somatic Delusions: Firm belief that a part of one’s body is abnormally functioning or appears abnormal.",
    "delusionalGroups":"The disorder often begins in young adulthood or middle age. The most challenging aspect is that patients firmly believe their delusions are real, making it difficult to persuade them to seek treatment. It is not advisable to directly confront these delusions or argue about their falsehood or suggest that they are a sign of illness. Instead, it is more effective to focus on how the delusions are affecting their emotions, sleep, appetite, and behavior to encourage them to seek medical help.",
    "ptsdSymptom":"Individuals who experience or witness significant traumatic events, such as earthquakes, plane crashes, severe car accidents, rape, or prolonged domestic abuse, often exhibit symptoms of acute stress reaction for a period.",
    "ptsdExplanation":"Common symptoms include insomnia, nightmares, recurrent flashbacks to the traumatic event, accompanied by severe physical discomfort such as palpitations, chest tightness, and trembling, feeling as though they are reliving the moment. Anxiety, dissociation, depression, and even thoughts of death, suicidal ideation, and suicidal behavior are also prevalent.\nIf these symptoms do not diminish over time, and if nightmares and recurrent memories persist, accompanied by ongoing anxiety and severe physical discomfort, if feelings of depression and guilt do not lessen, or even if there is emotional numbness, indifference to life, cynicism, and uncontrollable rage, it is advised that the affected individual seek medical attention promptly. Early medical intervention can minimize psychological damage and aid in the journey toward recovery.",
    "ptsdGroups":"Individuals who have experienced or witnessed significant traumatic events are at risk, regardless of their age.",
